# IBB-WIFI
Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality Public Wifi Hotspots User Count Based On Location From 2019 To 2021 Data.

# Summary
This dataset contains the number of users of IBB Wi-Fi Locations by years. The dataset contains static locations(station) represented as known location names and also contains moving vehicle name codes which are known as public transport vehicles. This dataset doesnâ€™t have Geospatial data all locations listed by their names. Additionally, 2021 data looks incomplete in terms of numbers so we might need to consider this factor when using it.
